# FreeSSHd source codes

The project website at http://www.freesshd.com/ seems to be abandoned and the tool hasn't been updated since 2009.

I found the source codes online and decided to publish it here to preserve it, in case the original website goes down. And maybe even fix some small stuff here and there, who knows.

I'm in now way asiciated with FreeSSHd. Just saving the source codes here for future generations. The license is MIT means I'm not violating anything by publishing it here.
